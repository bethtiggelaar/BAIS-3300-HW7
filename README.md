# BAIS-3300-HW7
This assignment's purpose was to show us how to make an inclusive web page and how to link multiple web pages together with buttons. Also, it taught us how a survey is meant to be designed.
The best way to create a survey is to make it inclusive. Within my surveys, I included multiple options for gender outside of (cis) woman and (cis) man. My specific options were man, woman, trans man, trans woman, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, non-binary, multi-gender, and decline to state. This is extremely important due to fact that it does not put stress on a person who does not conform to a binary gender or the gender they were assigned at birth.
Screen readers were another way I made my web page more inclusive. I downloaded ChromeVOX to my computer to check that all my web pages (welcome page, suvey 1, survey 2, and thank you page) worked with the reader. This adds accesibility for blind people or other people who use screen readers in their daily life.
The main two color used on the web pages were a specific yellow and black that were check with the WCAG Color Contrast Checker. Their contrast had a ratio of 19.24:1, which is much higher than the minimum requirement of 4.5:1. This contrast ratio passes all three checks under WCAG 2.1 level AAA (small text, large text, and UI components). Passing this test makes web pages easier to use for people who are color blind or have trouble seeing in general.
